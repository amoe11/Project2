Binary Converter


Introduction
This handy C++ program lets you easily convert decimal numbers into their binary equivalents.
Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, it provides a seamless way to split decimal inputs into integer and fractional parts, converting each using different methods tailored to their nature.

Key Features
- **Accurate Conversion:** Uses a stack-based linked list for the integer part and a queue-based linked list for the fractional part to ensure precision and correctness.
- **Precision Control:** Limits the binary representation of fractional parts to 20 bits to prevent excessively long or infinite binary sequences.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear and helpful feedback for non-numeric inputs or numbers that are too large to process.
- **User-Friendly:** Continuously prompts for numbers and displays results in an easy-to-read format until you decide to exit with a simple 'exit' command.

How to Run
1. Compile all the provided C++ files into an executable.
2. Launch the executable and follow the on-screen prompts.
3. Enter any decimal number to see its binary form split into integer and fractional outputs.
4. To convert another number, just enter a new one. When you’re done, type 'exit' to close the program.
